Gradient Control:

Modify the radialGradient stops to change the orb's inner glow
Adjust stop-opacity values for different transparency levels
Change colors by modifying the stop-color values
Glow Effect Customization:

Adjust stdDeviation in feGaussianBlur to change glow spread
Modify filter composition for different glow intensities
Stack multiple filters for complex effects
Animation Options:

Customize the pulse animation timing and scale
Add rotation or other transform effects
Create more complex animations using multiple keyframes
Size and Responsiveness:

Modify the viewBox for different aspect ratios
Adjust circle radius and position
Control scaling behavior
To customize, you can modify values like:

Change #39FF14 to any color code
Adjust stdDeviation="2" for different glow sizes
Modify r="35" for different orb sizes
Change animation timing in the pulse keyframes
Add more gradient stops for complex color effects
The SVG approach ensures crisp rendering at any size while maintaining the ability to animate and style dynamically.
